#### Challenge
Micro Leasing‚Äôs intention was to modernize its legacy infrastructure to maximize and streamline the level of service provided to its branch offices located across Thailand. Furthermore, the company also wanted to enable its employees to work remotely, especially during the pandemic, while improving Micro Leasing's efficiency and professional image as the industry leader in used truck hire-purchase financing.

Mr. Preeda Iramaneerat, deputy management director of Business Resources and Investment for Micro Leasing Pcl. said, ‚ÄúWe are a financial institution offering hire-purchase services and so we must adhere to stringent standards as well as robust customer data security to comply with regulatory requirements. We also require high-performance solutions that are scalable, can handle massive workloads, and provide our branches in 25 locations around the country simultaneous access to our core applications. Our hire-purchase department must also be able to function seamlessly from anywhere, at any time, enhancing our organization's professional image. We can confidently say that Nutanix meets every one of these requirements," Preeda added.

#### Solution
Micro Leasing deployed Nutanix Cloud Platform with its AHV hypervisor as well as Nutanix Disaster Recovery. Nutanix‚Äôs Intelligent Operations was also deployed, allowing Micro Leasing to monitor resource utilizations from all branches in one centralized console and automate day-to-day operational tasks. ‚ÄúWe also chose to deploy Citrix DaaS (Desktop-as-a-Service) Citrix Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) on Nutanix to enable employees to work from anywhere. And this supports our foresight, especially when the Covid-19 pandemic happened, as we were able to provide disruption-free services to our customers,‚Äù said Mr. Preeda.

Majority of the branch applications are hosted on Nutanix including its three new businesses: motorcycle hire-purchase, personal loans, and insurance brokers. These aim to help its customers maintain revolving funds for their business, and they need to be deployed in online channels across multiple platforms to ensure ease of access, and consistent customer experience across platforms.

#### Customer Outcome
**RTO improved from half a day to just 1 hour**

‚ÄúNutanix Disaster Recovery (DR) has helped us to shorten the time required to recover data from at least half a day to just one hour. We will now set a higher goal in hopes of achieving an RTO of 15 minutes in the very near future,‚Äù said Mr. Preeda.

Nutanix Cloud Platform and its DR system offers Micro Leasing with a hardened software platform for hyperconverged infrastructure. With a robust security posture as its foundation, the company was able to complete and maintain ISO/IEC 207001 compliance quickly.

**Handle 3 times increase in business workloads with ease**

Mr Preeda said, ‚ÄúNutanix is the right choice for us with its intuitive system and flexibility. It helped us to scale efficiently for a threefold increase in workload. The IT team did not need more hands to support this business growth and could even save more time from their usual daily operations. In fact, we were able to roll out new services to help our customers in times of crisis (covid) faster than before.‚Äù

‚ÄúAHV and Intelligent Operations worked well together to give us all we need in one console. With Nutanix‚Äôs one-click automations, it was much easier to deploy, backup and do upgrades,‚Äù he added.

Micro Leasing's operational efficiency has leapfrogged due to the effectiveness of the Nutanix Cloud Platform, which has delivered a consistent operating model across all types of clouds during the past three years, resulting in a 50% increase in customer share and a 40% increase in revenue.

**Next Steps**
For the next phase, Micro Leasing will partner with Nutanix to tailor their hybrid cloud solution. The company hopes to give the business true flexibility across clouds in terms of deployment and migration, and achieve best-in-class service availability, data security and compliance.

"Micro Leasing aims to strengthen IT through automation and cloud computing. We have always regarded automation and the cloud as significant future corporate growth engines. However, as a financial business, customer information requires precaution. Therefore, we must treat our customers' personal information with the utmost confidentiality," Mr Preeda concluded. "We are currently evaluating Nutanix hybrid cloud solutions and expect to install them soon since we foresee that they will enable the organization to utilize the performance and capabilities of the cloud with total efficiency and security," said Preeda.
